I want to build an application to send request for reviews for services provided by XYZ Dental Clinic. It should connect to a postgresDB, read a table (patient_dashboard). column names (patient name, email, phone number, physician name, hygienist name, assistant name, patient image). The dashboard should have the patient, displayed as tiles, containing the patient name, email address, phone number, and patient image as athumbnail, arranged vertically by physician name.
There should be a date picker and a button. The first action would be to select a date and click a button, which should populate the dashboard with the patients for that day.
On clicking a tile, a modal should open, which should connect to the project folder, go to /Images/ folder, grab the image by matching name for Physician, Hygienist, Assistant and Front Office. Arrange it in 2X2 matrix and display them in a iPhone screen with a message asking for a review for the services undertaken at the XYZ clinic. There should be a button (Send Review) here, clicking on which the contents inside the iphone screen gets sent as an email and SMS to the patient.
Please design a responsive and mobile friendly set of screens for me, with synthetic data, in a black, gold, and white color scheme. There should be a navigation dispalying the product name as "ReviewMe" and a logo for the same. The navigation menu should have Home, Reports, Blocked Patients, Admin Home, Sign Out.
